These instructions provide details on how to re-create the third party support libraries from source.

For each library, see software_version.yaml for download links, versions and license information.

These instructions all assume you have set the THIRD_PARTY_LIBS env var:

THIRD_PARTY_LIBS=/path/to/bass/third_party
mkdir -p $THIRD_PARTY_LIBS/include


Catch2
======

Download catch.hpp from the release and put it in $THIRD_PARTY_LIBS/include/catch2


GSL Lite
========

Download and extract tarball. From a bash prompt, cd into the directory and run:

Apply the gsl patches in $THIRD_PARTY_LIBS:
    for p in $THIRD_PARTY_LIBS/gsl-*.patch; do
        patch -Np1 -i $p
    done

Copy the headers:
    rm -rf $THIRD_PARTY_LIBS/include/gsl $THIRD_PARTY_LIBS/include/gsl.h
    cp -r include/* $THIRD_PARTY_LIBS/include/

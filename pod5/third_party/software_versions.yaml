# This information is both useful to developers and used to build third-party software information
# documents to include in our distributions (many open source licenses require this, and it's
# generally a good thing to do regardless).

# The license file should ideally be copied directly from the source distribution.

# The "files" field is used by the CI jobs to check that this file has been assembled correctly, and
# we didn't forget any licenses.
